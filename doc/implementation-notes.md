# Isotopes and Atomic Mass - Implementation Notes

This simulation was ported from a Java version, not started from scratch in HTML5.

The Java version of the simulation had two "flavors" - Build an Atom and Isotopes and Atomic Mass. Build an Atom has
been split into a separate simulation, and the code that is shared between the two is in a repository called
'shred'.

There are so many size relationships in this simulation that are not to scale that it was difficult to choose a scaling
unit. One could choose something like femtometers, and then use appropriate diameter values for neutrons and protons,
but the electron diameter would need to be way off, and the overall atom diameter would be too. Ultimately, the scale
that has been chosen is roughly pixels on the default size screen. This was called "screen units" back in the
Java/Piccolo days.

There are two main ways of representing an atom in the model, one where it is represented only by a set of numbers for
each type of constituent particle, and one that contains and manages references to constituent particles. The former is
called "NumberAtom" and the latter is "ParticleAtom". These are both pretty pervasive in the code.

Both NumberAtom and ParticleAtom end up having a number of derived properties that are important to know, such as
charge, atomic number, and atomic mass. The types themselves generally track this information and make it available in
the form of DerivedProperty.

The "Mixtures" screen needed to have a movable version of the isotopes, and initially this used NumberAtom to define the
atom configuration. However, this turned out to lead to excessive memory use after the PhET-iO features were added, so
the code was revamped to use a way of defining atom configurations called ImmutableAtomConfig. Both ImmutableAtomConfig
and NumberAtom have ES5 getters for protonCount, neutronCount, and electronCount, and this polymorphism is important to
the operation of the "Mixtures" screen.

MovableAtom also stores the colors for that isotopes of an element. Maximum number of isotopes for an element is 4, and
sulfur is the only element in the sim that reaches this max. Four colors have been used to distinguish between different
isotopes of an element.

The number of movable atoms of various isotopes in the test chamber determines the percent composition and average
atomic mass for that element.
